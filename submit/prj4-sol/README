To run the project use the following commad:
./index.js 2346 http://zdu.binghamton.edu:2345

For implementation of this project, made use of the already running 
instance at http://zdu.binghamton.edu:2345

The functionality of the project is similar to the sample solution
provided. Successfully tested for most of the test cases, input
validations and error handling.

A couple of changes implemented as compared to the provided sample solution:
1. In the search Sensor Type and Sensor pages, if an invalid Sensor Type ID or
 Sensor ID is provided, then the web service error is displayed eg. 
 'no results for sensor-type id xyz' as opposed to the error message
 'No results found.' that shows up in the sample solution.

2. Another case of validation that is slightly different from the sample 
 solution provided is that for the limits[min, max] and expected[min, max]
 fields in the Add Sensor Types and Add Sensor pages, the current project
 implementation enforces the user to input both the min and max values for
 the fileds in both cases(limits and expected) before validating the the
 provided values.
